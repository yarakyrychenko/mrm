In all three sub-studies similar ad-hoc measures were utilized. In Study 1, to measure ""belief in dissemination intentions of Covid-19 conspiracy theories"", participants read a series of conspiracy theories (8 unrelated to Covid-19, 2 related to Covid-19). For each conspiracy theory, participants rated their agreement with it (1= strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and also rated their intentions to share it online (1= not at all, 5 = very much). The Covid-19 related conspiracy theory scores were then used to form one latent score, whereas the non-Covid-19 related scores were used to form another, which was entered as a covariate. Similarly, in Study 2, participants read 7 Covid-19 related conspiracy theories and 3 facts about the Covid-19 pandemic. Again, participants rated conspiracy theories on 5-point scales regarding how much they agreed with them and how high their online-sharing intentions were. The 3 factual statements were treated as a ""Covid-19 knowledge variable"" and entered the model as a covariate.

The initial reporting, by the police, of the bombings as simultaneous ‘power surges’ suggests that they are covering up the real cause of the 7/7 bombings.  8. Several eyewitness accounts of the explosions on the underground speak of explosions under the floor of the train, indicating the bombs were planted and were not contained in backpacks. 12. British intelligence purposely failed to act on knowledge of the bomb plot in order to ferment anti-Muslim feeling.  4. The UK government allowed the 7/7 bombings to take place so that it would have an excuse to achieve foreign (e.g., extend wars in Afghanistan and Iraq) and domestic (e.g., attacks on civil liberties) goals that had been determined prior to the attacks.  7. The UK government allowed the 7/7 bombings to take place in order to rally the country around Tony Blair's faltering leadership.  3. The fact that the 7/7 bombers purchased return tickets and paid to park their cars at Luton suggests that the bombings were not planned as a suicide attack.  5. British government agencies, including the military and intelligence, dealt incompetently with the 7/7 bombings and sought to cover up its failures.  6.

British intelligence had knowledge of the 7/7 bomb plot as they had at least one of the bombers under their surveillance.  2.

Media Literacy for News Content • I compare new information I see in news with other information I have seen before I accept it as believable. • I look for more information before I believe something I see in news. • It is important to think twice about what news messages say. • I often consider whether a message in news is accurate. • I check on whether information I see in the news is up to date. Science Media Literacy Description 1=Strongly Disagree- 5=Strongly Agree Topics and measures Austin; Borah; Domgaard 9 COVID-19 knowledge items included common misperceptions that might be linked to confusion, evolving information, and mixed messages rather than to deliberately spread COVID-19 disinformation. Factor analysis and reliability analysis were used to verify that these items were most appropriately considered as separate from the COVID-19 disinformation items. For example, the use of garlic in some naturopathy traditions could lead to the belief that garlic could cure the virus, and some people get confused about the relevance of antibiotics for curing a virus. Knowledge items were drawn from information from the World Health Organization (2020), the Centers for Disease Control (2020b), and a contemporary RTI (2020) survey. Because knowledge and science media literacy were based on what individuals believed to be true, the variable was coded to represent “knowledge” or “a lack of knowledge.” The total score represented the number of correct responses to the questions. A response that represented an incorrect answer or an acknowledgment of uncertainty was coded as “a lack of knowledge.” Measures for media literacy for sources of news and media literacy for content of news were based on previous studies that have used these measures to represent self-reported media literacy skills. This study did not collect performance-based data about general media literacy skills, such as by having respondents do a message deconstruction exercise. • • • If two things are related, or correlated, it means that one caused the other. If a medication works well in animals, it will always work well in humans too. Research that randomizes people, animals, or plants to conditions and examines effects of a treatment in a controlled environment (randomized controlled trials) are often of higher quality than research that looks at associations. • If a medication or treatment works for one group of people, it will work for all people. • One scientific study often shifts an entire course of medical practice or public policy. • All journals that publish research are equally credible. • Scientific findings from the lab can be assumed to work the same way in the real world",NA,18,US,en,Yes,NA,No,Yes,NA,NA,Yes,No,Yes,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Scale,MediaLiteracy,NA,NA,The Science Literacy portion also constitutes somewhat of a knowledge test.,NA,Checking Sources,Yes,

I am not very good in solving problems that require careful logical analysis. I enjoy intellectual challenges. I prefer complex to simple problems. I don't like to have to do a lot of thinking. Reasoning things out carefully is not one of my strong points. I am not a very analytical thinker. I try to avoid situations that require thinking in depth about something. I am much better at figuring things out logically than most people. I have a logical mind. Using logic usually works well for me in figuring out problems in my life. Knowing the answer without understanding the reasoning behind it is good enough for me. I enjoy reading things that evoke visual images. I enjoy imagining things. I can clearly picture or remember some sculpture or natural object (not alive) that I think is very beautiful. I identify strongly with characters in movies or books I read. I tend to describe things by using images or metaphors, or creative comparisons. Art is really important to me. Sometimes I like to just sit back and watch things happen. I have favorite poems and paintings that mean a lot to me. When I travel or drive anywhere, I always watch the landscape and scenery. I almost never think in visual images. My emotions don't make much difference in my life. Emotions don't really mean much: they come and go. When I have a strong emotional experience, the effect stays with me for a long time. When I'm sad, it's often a very strong feeling. Things that make me feel emotional don't seem to affect other people as much. Everyday experiences often evoke strong feelings in me. I'd rather be upset sometimes and happy sometimes, than always feel calm. I don't react emotionally to scary movies or books as much as most people do. My anger is often very intense. When I'm happy, the feeling is usually more like contentment than like exhilaration or excitement. I like to rely on my intuitive impressions. I often go by my instincts when deciding on a course of action. I don't think it is a good idea to rely on ones intuition for important decisions. I trust my initial feelings about people. I tend to use my heart as a guide for my actions. I enjoy learning by doing something, instead of figuring it out first. I can often tell how people feel without them having to say anything. I generally don't depend on my feelings to help me make decisions.

Real: 1In a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems increases.2The internal energy of a substance can be explained as the sum of the diverse kinetic energies of the erratic microscopic motions of its constituent atoms, and of the potential energy of interactions between them.3In all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves an isolated system the entropy of that system increases.4When two initially isolated systems in separate but nearby regions of space, each in thermodynamic equilibrium with itself but not necessarily with each other, are then allowed to interact, they will eventually reach a mutual thermodynamic equilibrium.5The conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space gives rise to the conservation of angular momentum.6The voltage induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux it encloses.7As the result of a measurement the wave function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate.8The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.9A cyclic transformation whose only final result is to transform heat extracted from a source which is at the same temperature throughout into work is impossible.10For an unbalanced force acting on a body, the acceleration produced is proportional to the force impressed; the constant of proportionality is the inertial mass of the body",NA,20,US; CA,EN,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,NA,NA,Yes,No,No,No,No,Text,Lab,NoSource,Message,NoPlatform,Scale,DiscVeracity,NA,,,http://journal.sjdm.org/ 20/200221/jdm200221.pdf,Cognitive Reflection,Yes,
